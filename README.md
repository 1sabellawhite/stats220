# STATS220
## Data Technologies
### This is my repo for STATS 220. 

I am **really enjoying** this class so far!

I especially *love the use of cats*

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in environmental science, geography, and psychology.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to expand my knowledge of R programming as it is a very useful skill.
- I am interested in learning about data visualisation and I also found it very interesting how you used drawings to collect data.
