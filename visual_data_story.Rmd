I have collected data based on my observations of litter in the outdoor environment. My data collection focused on litter quantity, litter type, bin presence/absence, and the location of litter. I logged data into my survey as I observed litter in my environment.

## Litter Quantity

When I encountered litter in the environment, I counted the number of pieces within an approximately 2 metres by 2 metres square. The frequency of litter quantities plot demonstrates a right skew; low quantities of litter were observed most frequently, whereas larger quantities were observed less often. 

## Do Rubbish Bins Make a Difference?

Whether a bin is present or absent doesn't make much difference in the quantities of litter observed. However, if the bin was overflowing, a greater quantity of litter was observed. This is likely due to spill-over exacerbated by wind, causing large amounts of litter in a single area.

## Locaton of Litter

The highest quantities of litter tend to be found in building entrances. Wind may contribute to this pattern by blowing litter into a sheltered area where it becomes "trapped". A similar mechanism causes litter to become stuck in gardens, likely contributing to the high quantities observed. Foot paths and parks/green spaces tended to have the lowest quantities of litter observations. However, it is also important to note that my travel patterns influence these observation, where I frequently visit certain areas more than others, which may be reflected in the data.

## Which Litter Type is Most Common?

![Litter category frequency](plot4.png)


Paper/cardboard was the most frequently observed litter category, followed by food packaging. This plot demonstrates the number of times an observation of a particular litter type occurred, not the total count of each category. Through my observations I noted that there were large quantities of cigarette butts grouped together which is not captured in this plot. 


## Time of Litter Observations

![Count plot of hour of litter observation](plot5.png)

Litter observations frequently occurred in the morning, between 07:00 and 08:00. This pattern of observation largely reflects the time that I commute to university or work, in which I walk along highly trafficked, main roads, resulting in a large number of litter observations. The time that I leave university or work is more variable from day to day. Therefore, fewer observations are made in the afternoon/ evening hours than in the morning. The observations that occur in the middle of the day, approximately between 09:00 - 15:00, tend to be observations of litter at university as I walk between classes on the University of Auckland campus.
