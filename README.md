# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in environmental science, geography, and psychology.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to expand my knowledge of R programming as it is a very useful skill.
- I am interested in learning about data visualisation and I also found it very interesting how you used drawings to collect data.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
